### Date created
This project was created the 1st of March 2023.

### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
It's a Python program that uses data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com), a bike share system provider, to uncover bike share usage patterns in an interactive way.

The program asks the user for a city for which he/she wants to display data. Optionally, a month and/or day of week can be provided by the user to filter data.

As a result the program calculates a set of statistics based on the inputs given by the user. Some of them are:
- Most common month for bike travels
- Most common day of week
- Most frequent start and end times
- Most frequent start and end stations
- Most common trip from start to end
- Average trip duration
- Count of users by gendre
- Birth Year for youngest and oldest users

It even allows the user to display the raw data used for the statistics on a 5 rows basis.

### Files used
It uses the next data files:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
